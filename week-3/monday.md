## Monday
### Schema Design and Intro to SQL

### Core

**Daily Retros**

- What is a relational database?
- From the weekend, did you find any learning strategy useful that could be useful after hours?

**Challenges**
- [Database Drill: SQL Tutor](https://sqltutor.devbootcamp.com/)  _Switch driver/navigator roles on every question!_  
    - Guidance: Some questions have additional sorting requirements that are not explicitly mentioned in the questions themselves, e.g. if you hit a question where your query is generating the same results as the desired results, but in a slightly different order.  
    - Additional guidance: Note there [are three different syntactical forms for the COUNT() function](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_func_count.asp).  
    - Additional additional guidance: Become familiar with [GROUP BY](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) and [HAVING](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)  
    - Additional additional additional guidance: In SQL Tutor, there is a difference between single quotes `'` and double quotes `"`, so if you are getting weird errors with double quotes, use single quotes, or vice versa.  
    - Also: SQL docs [here](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/).
- [Database Drill: Intro to SQLite](../../../../database-drill-intro-to-sqlite-challenge) - if not finished over the weekend.
- [Poll Database Design](../../../../poll-database-design-challenge)  
  Guidance: You will need to design your database in such a way that you could write queries that answer the following questions: 1) Which polls did the user with id #2 create?, 2) Which polls did the user with id #2 respond to?, 3) What was user #2's response to poll #7?, 4) What are the choices for poll # 4?  
  Additional guidance: all of your users should be in _one_ table, and all of your polls should be in _one_ table.  
- [Voting Results: Queries](../../../../sql-voting-results-retrieving-data-challenge)  
  Guidance: Be aware of COUNT() and GROUP BY and HAVING, see links above  
- [University DB Schema](../../../../university-course-database-design-challenge)  
  Guidance for Release 0:  Your database should be designed in such a way that it could successfully answer the following queries: 1) What classes is student #6 attending?, 2) What students are in class #6?, 3) What was the final grade for student #2 in class #7?, 4) Who is the teacher for class #12?, 5) Which class is teacher #9 teaching?  
  Guidance for Release 1: You will need to enforce constraints on your database to meet some of the criteria. If schema designer proves inadequate to display these constraints, you can write any constraints in a separate file. (Here is an example constraint: table1 will only allow a new record to save if that new record contains a unique value in field1 (no other record in table1 has the same value in field1))  
- [Voting Results: Modifying Data](../../../../sql-voting-results-modifying-data-challenge)  
  Guidance: Be sure to know how to use UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT INTO  

**Prep for Tomorrow**

- Retros
  - What are good ways to translate code to a schema design and vice versa?
  - What is normalized data and why?
  - What are the different programming tools that you learned and how do they fit together?
  - What is brought you to DBC? Don't lose sight of it.
  
- [Object-relational Mapping](../readings/object-relational-mapping/README.md)
