### Data Structures

### Core

**Workshop**

Object and References

**Daily Retros**

- Why would you use an array vs. a hash?
- How is different working alone instead of with a pair? What's easier? What's harder?

**Prep for Tomorrow**
- **Daily Retros**

  - How did you choose the algorithm and data structure for sudoku?
  - In hindsight, what would you do differently?
