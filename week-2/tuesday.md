### Object Oriented Design with Inheritance and Composition


### Core

**Daily Retros**

- How do you decide when to use inheritance vs module? Why would you use one over the other?
- What are indicators that signal that you should continue working or ask for help?
- Do you and your partner spend too much time on certain problems? How can you mitigate this?

**Challenges**

- [Parsing Data 1](../../../../parsing-data-1-csv-in-csv-out-challenge)
- [Design Drill: Classical Inheritance](../../../../design-drill-classical-inheritance-challenge)
- [Cookies and Ovens](../../../../cookies-and-ovens-challenge)

**Prep for Tomorrow**
- Daily retros
  - How does time pressure effect coding for you?
  - Do you have any strategies that you help you with time management?
- Watch [Refactoring with Modules & Inheritance](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/refactoring-with-modules-and-inheritance) (closed captioning available)
